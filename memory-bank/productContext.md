# TKO Toy Co Loyalty Program - Product Context

**IMPORTANT: Always read .clinerules first, followed by ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task.**

See `memory-bank/taskWorkflow.md` for detailed task management procedures.

## Business Problem

TKO Toy Co is a specialty retailer of Trading Card Game (TCG) products, focusing primarily on Pok√©mon, Magic The Gathering, and One Piece card games, along with related accessories and collectibles. They operate both physical stores and an online Shopify presence. While they have a dedicated customer base, they face several challenges:

1. **Customer Retention**: In the competitive collectibles market, customer loyalty is crucial but difficult to maintain without structured incentives.

2. **Purchase Frequency**: Customers may make sporadic purchases rather than regular visits.

3. **Average Order Value**: There's potential to increase the average spend per customer through targeted incentives.

4. **Cross-Channel Shopping**: Customers who shop both in-store and online represent higher lifetime value, but there's currently no system to encourage this behavior.

5. **Premium Experience**: TKO Toy Co wants to differentiate itself by offering a premium, exclusive experience for loyal customers.

The loyalty program aims to address these challenges by creating a structured system that rewards customer loyalty, encourages repeat purchases, and enhances the overall customer experience. The program features a unique boxing-themed tier system with levels named after boxing weight classes (Featherweight, Lightweight, Welterweight, Heavyweight, and Champion), adding a distinctive and memorable branding element to the loyalty experience.
