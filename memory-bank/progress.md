## Known Issues

1. TypeScript errors in database configuration:

   - ✓ Fixed: `underscoredAll` property issue in database configuration

2. Simplified Transaction Approach:

   - Updated approach to focus on pulling total spend amounts from external systems
   - Simplified transaction handling - we don't need detailed transaction tracking
   - Using total spend data only for tier assignment

3. Need to implement comprehensive testing for controllers and routes

## Technical Debt

1. Need to implement unit tests for repositories and services
2. Should optimize database queries for performance
3. Need to add comprehensive input validation for all service methods
4. Should implement proper error handling for external API integrations
5. Need to add more detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Integration approach updated - Shopify App:

   - ✓ Re-evaluated integration options (Standalone, Shopify App, BinderPOS Integration)
   - ✓ Updated approach to implement as a fully integrated Shopify app
   - ✓ Created Shopify app scaffold using Shopify CLI

   - ✓ Updated activeContext.md to reflect the decision
   - ✓ Set up environment variables for Shopify integration
   - ✓ Resolved deployment issues with Render.com:
