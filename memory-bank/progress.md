## Known Issues

1. Shopify App Integration:

   - ✓ Fixed: App distribution configuration issue
   - ✓ Fixed: Authentication flow for admin access
   - ✓ Fixed: URL configuration for Render.com deployment

2. Simplified Transaction Approach:

   - Updated approach to focus on pulling total spend amounts from Shopify
   - Using total spend data only for tier assignment
   - Need to adapt this approach for points-based system

3. Current System Limitations:
   - System is currently tied to total spend for tier assignment
   - No support for additional points from events or promotions
   - No point history tracking
   - No annual reset mechanism

## Technical Debt

1. Need to implement comprehensive testing for points system
2. Should optimize database queries for performance with points data
3. Need to add proper error handling for point calculations
4. Should implement better logging for point transactions
5. Need to create data migration strategy for transitioning to points system

   - Update database schema to add point-related fields
   - Modify customer service to calculate and track points
   - Update metafields service to store points information in Shopify
   - Update UI components to display points information

2. Point Events System:

   - Create database schema for point events
   - Implement event management service
   - Build admin interface for creating and managing events
   - Implement point calculation logic for events

3. Annual Reset Mechanism:

   - Design data structure for historical point tracking
   - Implement scheduled task for annual reset (starting 2026)
   - Create point transaction records for resets
   - Build reporting for historical point data

4. Admin Interface Updates:

   - Update customer display to show point breakdown
   - Create point history/transactions view
   - Implement manual point adjustment interface
   - Build point events management UI

5. Testing and Validation:
   - Test point calculation accuracy
