## Known Issues

1. TypeScript errors in database configuration:

   - ✓ Fixed: `underscoredAll` property issue in database configuration

2. Simplified Transaction Approach:

   - Updated approach to focus on pulling total spend amounts from external systems
   - Simplified transaction handling - we don't need detailed transaction tracking
   - Using total spend data only for tier assignment

3. Need to implement comprehensive testing for controllers and routes

## Technical Debt

1. Need to implement unit tests for repositories and services
2. Should optimize database queries for performance
3. Need to add comprehensive input validation for all service methods
4. Should implement proper error handling for external API integrations
5. Need to add more detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Integration approach determined - Standalone Application:

   - ✓ Evaluated integration options (Standalone, Shopify App, BinderPOS Integration)
   - ✓ Selected Standalone Application approach for maximum flexibility and control
   - ✓ Documented the approach and architectural implications in `memory-bank/integration/integration-approach.md`
   - ✓ Updated activeContext.md to reflect the decision

2. Connect frontend to backend API:

   - Replace mock data with actual API calls
   - Implement API service layer in frontend
   - Add loading states and error handling for API requests
   - Ensure proper authentication token management

3. Implement integration with external systems:

   - Create Shopify integration module with OAuth authentication
   - Develop BinderPOS integration module with API key authentication
   - Implement data synchronization service
   - Set up webhooks for Shopify and scheduled synchronization for BinderPOS

4. Develop data aggregation logic:

   - Create customer spend calculation service
   - Implement tier assignment rules
   - Set up data consistency checks
   - Create audit logging for data changes

5. Develop testing after implementation:
   - Create tests based on the actual implementation
   - Focus on critical paths and integration points
   - Ensure end-to-end functionality with real data
