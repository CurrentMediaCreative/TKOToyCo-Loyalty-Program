   - Set up proper type definitions for all data structures

5. **Service Layer**
   - Implemented ICustomerService interface
   - Created MockDataService with sample customer data
   - Set up ServiceFactory for dependency injection
   - Implemented tier progress calculation logic

6. **UI Components - Customer Popup**
   - Created CustomerLookup component for searching customers
   - Implemented CustomerPopup component for displaying loyalty information
   - Added tier progress visualization
   - Implemented "close to next tier" notification
   - Added benefit listing and next tier preview

7. **UI Components - Admin Dashboard**
   - Created MainWindow component with navigation sidebar
   - Implemented Dashboard component with statistics and charts
   - Created Customers component with customer listing and search
   - Implemented Tiers component for tier management
   - Added Reports component for data visualization
   - Created Settings component for application configuration

## Current Status

The desktop application structure has been fully implemented according to the Phase 1 requirements. The application includes:

- A system tray icon and menu with options for both admin and popup windows
- A customer lookup interface for quick customer information access
- A popup window displaying customer loyalty information
- Tier progress visualization with "close to next tier" notification
- Current benefits display and next tier preview
- A comprehensive admin dashboard with:
  - Statistics overview and data visualization
  - Customer management interface
  - Tier configuration and management
  - Reports and analytics
  - Application settings
- Mock data service for development with sample customer data
- IPC communication between main and renderer processes

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies** ✓
   - Completed: Successfully installed all required dependencies with `npm install`
   - Resolved TypeScript errors in the code
   - Dependencies include React, Material-UI, Electron, and other necessary packages

2. **Create Proper Tray Icon** ✓
   - Completed: Verified that a proper tray icon exists in the assets/icons directory
   - The icon uses TKO brand colors and follows design guidelines
   - Icon is properly configured in the main.ts file for system tray integration

3. **Test Application** (In Progress)
   - Currently running the application in development mode with `npm run dev`
   - Testing customer lookup functionality in the popup window
   - Verifying tier progress visualization and notifications
   - Testing admin dashboard components and navigation
   - Verifying window management (show/hide) for both windows
   - Testing IPC communication between windows

4. **Implement Real Data Services**
   - Create API service implementation to replace mock data
   - Implement authentication and secure API communication
   - Add offline support with local data caching
   - Implement synchronization between local and remote data

5. **Prepare for Production**
   - Add error handling and logging
   - Implement automatic updates
   - Create installer and distribution packages
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds

## Technical Notes

- **Architecture**
  - Dual-window architecture with separate admin and popup windows
  - The application uses Electron's contextBridge for secure IPC communication
  - Window management includes proper handling of close events to hide instead of quit
  - The tray icon provides quick access to both windows
  - Single instance lock mechanism prevents multiple instances of the application from running simultaneously

- **UI Design**
  - React components are designed to be responsive within both windows
  - Material-UI is used for consistent styling matching the main web application
  - The theme uses TKO brand colors and styling guidelines
  - Admin dashboard follows the same design patterns as the web application

- **Data Management**
  - The service layer is designed with interfaces to allow easy switching between mock and real implementations
  - Mock data service provides realistic sample data for development
  - Data models use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - Tier progress calculations are implemented in the service layer

- **IPC Communication**
  - Main process exposes API methods to renderer processes via preload script
  - Renderer processes can communicate with each other through the main process
  - Events are used for asynchronous communication
  - Settings are stored using electron-store for persistence

- **Development Workflow**
  - Concurrent development of main and renderer processes
  - Hot reloading for renderer process during development
  - TypeScript compilation for type checking and better developer experience
  - Separate tsconfig files for main and renderer processes
