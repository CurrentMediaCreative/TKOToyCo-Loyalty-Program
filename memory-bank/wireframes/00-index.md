## How to Use These Wireframes

These wireframes are created using Mermaid diagrams, which provide a visual representation of the interface structure. Each wireframe file includes:

1. A diagram showing the interface layout and component relationships
2. Key components description
3. User interactions explanation
4. Additional relevant details specific to that interface

The wireframes are intended to serve as a foundation for discussion and refinement before moving to implementation. They represent the core functionality required for the TKO Toy Co Loyalty Program based on the requirements documented in the memory bank.

## Next Steps

1. Review each wireframe and provide feedback
2. Refine interfaces based on feedback
3. Create detailed component specifications
4. Develop UI components based on approved wireframes
5. Implement backend services to support the interfaces
