## Unfinished/Half-Implemented Features

1. **Customer Loyalty Card**:

   - "View Full Profile" button in CustomerLoyaltyCard.tsx doesn't appear to be functional
   - Uses placeholder calculations for customer consistency and average monthly spend

2. **Rewards System**:

   - `app.rewards.tsx` route exists but implementation status is unclear
   - No reward models in the database schema

3. **Reports Feature**:

   - "View Reports" button exists in the dashboard but the corresponding route may not be implemented

4. **Send Loyalty Update**:
   - Button exists in the dashboard but functionality may not be implemented

## Recommendations

1. **Create Archive Directory**:

   - Create an `archive` directory in the root of the project
   - Move all outdated code to this directory
   - Add the archive directory to `.gitignore`

2. **Clean Up Legacy Code**:

   - Move the entire `src/backend/`, `src/desktop/`, `src/frontend/`, and `src/styling-backup/` directories to the archive
   - These are from previous implementation attempts and are no longer needed

3. **Update Memory Bank Documentation**:

   - Move `desktop-implementation-progress.md` and `integration/desktop-app-approach.md` to the archive
   - Update other documentation to reflect the current Shopify app implementation

4. **Complete Half-Implemented Features**:

   - Implement or remove the "View Full Profile" functionality
   - Complete the rewards system implementation if it's intended to be part of the app
   - Implement or remove the "View Reports" and "Send Loyalty Update" functionality

5. **Prepare for Points System**:
   - Update database schema to include point-related fields
   - Extend metafields implementation to handle points
   - Update UI components to display point information

## Audit Status

**COMPLETED: June 19, 2025**

The audit has been completed, and the following actions have been taken:

1. **Create Archive Structure**: ✅

   - Created `Loyalty Program Application/archive/` directory
   - Created subdirectories for backend, desktop, frontend, styling, and memory-bank

2. **Move Legacy Code**: ✅

   - Moved outdated directories to the archive:
     - `src/backend` → `archive/backend`
     - `src/desktop` → `archive/desktop`
     - `src/frontend` → `archive/frontend`
     - `src/styling-backup` → `archive/styling`
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude the archive directory

3. **Update Documentation**: ✅

   - Moved outdated documentation to the archive:
     - `memory-bank/desktop-implementation-progress.md` → `archive/memory-bank/`
     - `memory-bank/integration/desktop-app-approach.md` → `archive/memory-bank/`

4. **Evaluate Unfinished Features**: ✅

   - Reviewed half-implemented features as documented in the "Unfinished/Half-Implemented Features" section
   - These will be addressed as part of the points system implementation

## Next Steps: Points System Implementation

The next phase of the project will involve implementing the points-based loyalty system:

1. **Update Database Schema**:

   - Add fields for tracking different types of points (spend points, bonus points, total points)
   - Update the Prisma schema and create migrations

2. **Modify Services**:

   - Update customer service to use points instead of direct spend for tier assignment
   - Extend metafields service to include points information in Shopify metafields

3. **Update UI Components**:
   - Modify customer card and customer list to display points information
   - Add UI for managing bonus points
