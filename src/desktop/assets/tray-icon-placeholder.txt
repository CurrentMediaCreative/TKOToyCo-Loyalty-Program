This is a placeholder for the tray icon.

In a real implementation, you would need to create a proper icon file (PNG or ICO) for the system tray.
The icon should be:
- 16x16 pixels for standard display
- 32x32 pixels for high-DPI displays
- Use the TKO brand colors: Keppel/Teal (#00B8A2), Sunglow/Yellow (#FFD23F), Pumpkin/Orange (#FF7C2A)

The icon design should be simple and recognizable in the system tray, possibly showing:
- A simplified TKO logo
- A loyalty card icon
- Or a simple "TKO" text with a distinctive background

For development purposes, you can use a free icon from a library like Material Icons or Font Awesome,
or create a simple custom icon using a tool like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or even online icon generators.
